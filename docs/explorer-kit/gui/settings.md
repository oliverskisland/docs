## Locator setup

Select which locator you are using and which channel you would like to use. The Water Linked default channel is 17. This is also the preset channel for the Locator-S1. 

!!! warning
    If you are using the Locator-A1 or S1, you need to provid depth information to the topside unit. Description on how to do this is found [here](https://waterlinked.github.io/docs/explorer-kit/gui/api/).


## Global reference system

In this section you have the option to choose which GPS and IMU source you are going to use. We suggest to use static or external GPS when your operation allows for it. The master-D1 electronics has a standard GPS receiver with a standard deviation of around 3 meters. 

How to input external GPS and IMU with the API is decribed [here](https://waterlinked.github.io/docs/explorer-kit/gui/api).

## User preferences

In the user preferences section you can select the unit of measurements you want to use. We support both Metric and Imperial. You can also select if you want a dummy boat to be displayed on the map pages and the receiver configuration page.
